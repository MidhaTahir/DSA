## DATA STRUCTURES
Data Structures is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively. It is used for:

- Creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- To manage and organize data.
- To make code cleaner.

## Computational Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity (__time__ the algorithm needs to finish)
- Space Complexity (__space__ the algorithm needs to compute)

### BIG-O NOTATION:
Big-O Notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the __worst__ case, helping quantify performance as the input size becomes _arbitrarily large_.
